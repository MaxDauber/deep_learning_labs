### Assignment1

A 1-layer neural network was implemented from scratch using Python. The neural network is trained using MiniBatch gradient descent which is applied to a cost function that computes cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labeled training data and an L2 regularization term on the weight matrix. The dataset CIFAR10 is used, which consists of 10,000 32x32 images corresponding to 10 classes of objects. 
1. Download [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) to a folder 'Datasets' and ensure you are using the Python version
2. Run Assignment1.py
